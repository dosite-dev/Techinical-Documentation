                    Javascript is cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is small and lightweight language.Inside a host environment
                    (for example,a web browser),Javascript can be connected to the 
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side Javascript extends the core language by supplying
                        objects to control a browser and its Document object Model(DOM).
                        Forexample,client-side extensins allow  an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form  and respond to user events such as mouse
                        clicks,form input,and page navigation. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side Javascript extends the core language by supplying
                        objects relevant to running Javascript on server.For example,
                        server-side extensions allow  an application to communicate with a
                        database ,provide continunity of information from one invocation to
                        another of the application,or perform file maplications on a
                        server.

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                    The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow 
                    constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
                     JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types 
                     representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object 
                     model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides 
                     dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                      supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
                     Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare
                     all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods 
                     are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                     Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
